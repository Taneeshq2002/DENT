The project is a **Python-based GUI application** designed to automate data entry tasks, particularly for handling multiple records stored in Excel files. Developed using `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `openpyxl` for Excel file manipulation, this project significantly reduces manual input time by streamlining the process of entering data into specific fields from multiple records.

The application enables the user to **upload an Excel file containing multiple records**, which are then entered into the form fields one by one. The **auto-population feature** eliminates the need for the user to manually input each record into the fields. After reviewing or editing the auto-filled data, the user can submit the data, which is then saved to another Excel file, and the next record is automatically loaded. This allows for seamless data handling without requiring the user to manually go back and forth between the application and the Excel file.

Key features include:
1. **File Upload**: Users can upload an Excel file with multiple records. The data from the selected file is read sequentially, and the fields are populated automatically.
2. **Data Review and Submission**: The user can review the data in the fields and, if necessary, make changes before submitting it. Each record is saved in an output Excel file, and the next record is immediately loaded for review.
3. **Efficiency**: This automation improves workflow efficiency by reducing manual tasks, especially for large datasets, making it ideal for scenarios like form submissions or repetitive data entry.

This project showcases skills in Python, GUI design, and file handling, demonstrating the ability to automate routine tasks and improve productivity in real-world data management processes.
